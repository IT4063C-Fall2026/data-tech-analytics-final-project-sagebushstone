### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->
*Edited as of Checkpoint 1
#### What went well?
 - Successfully getting all my data
#### What did not go well?
 - Needed to switch my dataset plan since the Google Geocoding API was just not feasible for the number of calls I would have had to make.
 - Had to make more calls to the RentCast API than I would have wanted due to silly mistake when generating the API URL
#### What did you learn?
 - APIs are expensive and have limits. 
 - How to use geopandas
#### What would you do differently next time?
 - Do more research about how the APIs function before starting to use them; this reduces costs and is more efficient

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
